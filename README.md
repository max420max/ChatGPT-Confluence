## Confluence Chatbot with GPT-3.5-turbo and Tokenizer

This Streamlit application allows users to interact with a chatbot that retrieves information from a selected Confluence space and generates responses using the OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo model.

### Features

* **Confluence Integration:** Connects to a Confluence instance to fetch page content and metadata.
* **GPT-3.5-turbo Model:** Leverages the power of OpenAI's language model for generating contextually relevant and informative responses.
* **Tokenization:** Efficiently manages text input to stay within the model's token limits.
* **Chat History:** Maintains a conversation history for reference.
* **Space Selection:** Allows users to choose from available Confluence spaces.
* **Relevant Links:** Provides links to relevant Confluence pages alongside chatbot responses.
* **Error Handling and Logging:** Includes error handling and logging for improved robustness.
